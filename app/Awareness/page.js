        <p className='my-10 text-left '>E-waste is electronic products that are unwanted, not working, and nearing or at the end of their “useful life.” Computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are everyday electronic products.The ongoing challenge of how best to dispose of used and unwanted electronics isn’t a new one and dates back at least to the 1970s. But a lot has changed since then, particularly the number of electronics being discarded today.We also have something else today: a term for this issue. After several terms got suggested, including “Digital rubbish,” a consensus formed around the simple word “e-waste.”</p>
        <p className='text-left'>E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.</p>

                    <b className="text-black font-bold">Toxic Chemicals:</b> Many electronic devices contain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants. When e-waste ends up in landfills or is incinerated, these toxins can leach into the soil, groundwater, and the air, leading to soil and water pollution and air pollution.

                <li className='pb-4'>
                    <b className="text-black font-bold">Resource Depletion:</b> Electronic devices require significant amounts of natural resources to manufacture. When e-waste is not recycled, these valuable resources are lost, and new materials must be mined, causing environmental degradation. For example, mining for rare earth metals, often found in electronics, can result in habitat destruction and water pollution.
